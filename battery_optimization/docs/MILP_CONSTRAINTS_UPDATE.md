# MILP Formulation - Complete Constraint Set

## Update Summary
Successfully added missing constraints to the MILP optimization formulation for more realistic battery operation modeling.

## Added Constraints

### 1. **C-rate Constraints** (Power/Capacity Relationship)
```python
battery_kw ≤ battery_kwh * 1.0   # Maximum C-rate: 1.0C
battery_kw ≥ battery_kwh * 0.25  # Minimum C-rate: 0.25C
```
Ensures realistic power-to-capacity ratios for commercial batteries.

### 2. **Mutual Exclusion** (Charge/Discharge)
```python
charging[t] ∈ {0,1}  # Binary variable
charge[t] ≤ BigM * charging[t]
discharge[t] ≤ BigM * (1 - charging[t])
```
Prevents simultaneous charging and discharging using Big-M method.

### 3. **Cyclic SOC Constraint**
```python
soc[end_of_day] ≤ soc[start_of_day]
```
Ensures energy balance - battery can't gain "free" energy over a day.

### 4. **Minimum Cycles Constraint**
```python
Σ discharge[t] ≥ battery_kwh * 0.5 * n_days
```
Ensures at least 0.5 cycles/day (182 cycles/year) for realistic usage.

### 5. **Maximum Daily Depth of Discharge**
```python
Σ discharge[day] ≤ battery_kwh * 0.8
```
Limits daily DOD to 80% for battery longevity.

## Test Results

With full constraints implemented:
- **Optimal Battery**: 200 kWh @ 100 kW (0.50C)
- **Solver**: OR-Tools CBC
- **Status**: OPTIMAL (0.00 optimality gap)
- **Computation Time**: 50.77 seconds
- **NPV**: 18.9M NOK (with test data)

## Comparison: Before vs After

### Before (Missing Constraints)
- Could have unrealistic C-rates (e.g., 100 kW on 10 kWh = 10C!)
- Allowed simultaneous charge/discharge (physically impossible)
- No energy balance enforcement (free energy gains)
- No minimum usage requirements

### After (Full Constraints)
- ✅ Realistic C-rates (0.25C - 1.0C)
- ✅ Physically valid operation (mutual exclusion)
- ✅ Energy conservation (cyclic SOC)
- ✅ Minimum utilization (182+ cycles/year)
- ✅ Battery protection (max 80% daily DOD)

## Formulation Type
This is a **Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP)** problem:
- **Continuous variables**: battery size, power flows, SOC
- **Binary variables**: charging state, tariff tier selection
- **Linear constraints**: All relationships are linear
- **Guarantees**: Optimal solution within linear model assumptions

## Solver Hierarchy
1. **OR-Tools CBC** (Google, installed and working)
2. **PuLP CBC** (fallback if OR-Tools unavailable)
3. **HiGHS** (scipy solver, last resort)

## Files Modified
- `src/optimization/milp_optimizer.py` - Added all constraints
- `test_milp_constraints.py` - New test file for validation

## Conclusion
The MILP formulation now includes all essential physical and operational constraints, making it suitable for realistic battery optimization with guaranteed optimal solutions within the linear framework.
