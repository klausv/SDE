  - Battery charging only **3.2%** of the time ‚ùå
- During **most expensive 10% of hours** (avg 1.310 NOK/kWh):
  - Battery discharging only **9.6%** of the time ‚ùå

### 3. Zero Peak Shaving Benefits ‚ö†Ô∏è

**All 12 months show 0.00 kW peak reduction**
- Monthly peaks range from 47-79 kW
- Battery never operates to reduce peak demand
- Missing power tariff optimization opportunity (~12.5% of costs)

### 4. Minimal Curtailment Prevention

## Critical Limitations of Heuristic Strategy

### SimpleRule Strategy Logic
```python
# Current heuristic rules:
1. Charge on solar surplus (when production > consumption)
2. Charge at night (00:00-06:00) when prices < 0.3 quantile
3. Discharge when deficit AND prices > 0.8 quantile
```

### Why This Fails
1. **Fixed thresholds don't adapt** to actual price distribution
   - 0.3 quantile ‚â† actually cheap prices
   - 0.8 quantile ‚â† actually expensive prices

2. **No look-ahead capability**
   - Cannot anticipate upcoming cheap/expensive periods
   - Cannot plan charging/discharging cycles

3. **No peak tariff optimization**
   - Doesn't track or minimize monthly peaks
   - Missing 12.5% of cost reduction opportunity

4. **Conservative operation**
   - Battery stays idle most of the time
   - Underutilizes available capacity

## Recommended Path Forward

### Phase 1: Implement LP Optimization Model ‚≠ê **PRIORITY**

**Objective**: Maximize annual savings through perfect foresight optimization

**Model formulation**:
```
Minimize: Total_Cost = Energy_Cost + Peak_Cost

Subject to:
- Battery SOC dynamics (charge/discharge balance)
- Power limits (10 kW charge/discharge)
- SOC limits (10-90% of capacity)
- Monthly peak tracking
- Grid export limit (77 kW)
- Energy conservation

Decision variables:
- Battery charge/discharge power each hour
- Grid import/export power each hour
- Monthly peak power levels
```

**Expected benefits**:
- Optimal arbitrage: Buy at 0.24 NOK/kWh, sell at 0.97 NOK/kWh
- Peak shaving: Reduce monthly peaks by 5-10 kW
- Increased utilization: 20-30% active time vs current 3.7%
- **Estimated savings: 5,000-10,000 NOK/year** (4-8x improvement)

### Phase 2: Battery Sizing Optimization

**Current analysis**: 20 kWh @ 10 kW is undersized

**Recommended analysis**:
- Test range: 40-120 kWh capacity
- Test range: 20-60 kW power
- Find optimal size/cost trade-off
- Run LP optimization for each size

**Expected optimal**: 80-100 kWh @ 40-50 kW

### Phase 3: Advanced Strategies

1. **Predictive optimization** with forecasted prices
   - Rolling horizon optimization
   - Price prediction models
   - Update hourly based on latest forecasts

2. **Multi-objective optimization**
   - Balance arbitrage vs peak shaving
   - Include grid service revenues (if available)
   - Consider battery degradation explicitly

3. **Stochastic optimization**
   - Handle forecast uncertainty
   - Robust optimization approach
   - Risk-adjusted decision making
