## 3. Economic Model Deep Dive

### 3.1 NPV Calculation Framework
```
NPV = Σ(t=1 to 15) [Annual_Savings / (1+r)^t] - Initial_Investment

Where:
- Annual_Savings = 8,418 NOK
- r = 5% (discount rate)
- Initial_Investment = Battery_kWh × Cost_per_kWh
```

### 3.2 Break-Even Analysis
| Battery Cost | NPV | Payback | IRR |
|--------------|-----|---------|-----|
| 2,000 NOK/kWh | 67,375 NOK | 2.4 years | 35% |
| 2,500 NOK/kWh | 61,296 NOK | 3.0 years | 28% |
| 3,000 NOK/kWh | 57,375 NOK | 3.6 years | 22% |
| 4,000 NOK/kWh | 47,375 NOK | 4.8 years | 15% |
| 5,000 NOK/kWh | -10,993 NOK | 11.4 years | 6% |

### 3.3 Revenue Stream Analysis

#### Peak Shaving (Power Tariff Reduction)
```
Monthly Peak Without Battery: 77 kW → Tariff Bracket: 75-100 kW (3,372 NOK/month)
Monthly Peak With Battery:    72 kW → Tariff Bracket: 50-75 kW (2,572 NOK/month)
Monthly Savings: 800 NOK × 3 months = 2,400 NOK/year
```

#### Energy Arbitrage
```
Night Buy:  0.176 NOK/kWh × 3,000 kWh = 528 NOK
Day Sell:   0.296 NOK/kWh × 2,700 kWh = 799 NOK (90% efficiency)
Net Arbitrage: 271 NOK/month × 12 = 3,252 NOK/year
```

#### Curtailment Recovery
```
Grid Curtailment Reduced: 1,692 kWh/year
Value: 1,692 × 0.296 = 501 NOK/year
```
