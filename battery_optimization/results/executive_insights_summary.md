## Strategic Recommendations

### 🎯 PRIMARY RECOMMENDATION: Do Not Invest
**Current Market (2024):** Battery costs at 5,000 NOK/kWh make investment uneconomical
**Target Scenario Analysis:** Even at 2,500 NOK/kWh, NPV remains negative (-30,341 NOK)
**Action Plan:** Focus on alternative energy optimization strategies without battery storage

### 🔧 Technical Readiness Actions
1. **System Design:** Finalize electrical integration plans and permitting
2. **Supplier Evaluation:** Identify qualified battery system providers
3. **Installation Planning:** Secure certified installers and project timeline
4. **Monitoring Setup:** Prepare performance tracking and optimization systems

### 📊 Financial Decision Framework

| Battery Cost (NOK/kWh) | NPV (NOK) | Payback (Years) | Decision |
|-------------------------|-----------|-----------------|----------|
| **5,000 (Current)** | -61,625 | >15 years | ❌ Do not proceed |
| **3,500** | 12,875 | 4.6 years | ⚠️ Marginal case |
| **2,500 (Target)** | 61,296 | 3.0 years | ✅ Strong business case |
| **2,000 (Future)** | 87,125 | 2.4 years | ✅ Excellent opportunity |
