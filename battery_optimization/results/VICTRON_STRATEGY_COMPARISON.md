# Victron ESS Battery Control Strategy Analysis
**Comparison with Current Implementation**

---

## Executive Summary

Victron Energy offers **two battery control approaches** for grid-connected solar PV systems:

1. **Standard ESS** - Rule-based self-consumption optimization (similar to our current SimpleRule)
2. **Dynamic ESS** - Optimization-based strategy using price forecasts and scheduling (similar to our proposed LP model)

**Key Finding**: Victron's **Dynamic ESS** validates our conclusion that optimization-based control significantly outperforms simple heuristics for price arbitrage and cost minimization.

## Victron ESS Standard Strategy

### Operating Modes

**1. Self-Consumption (Optimize Mode)**
- Battery supplies all loads when possible
- Keeps grid meter at 0W (zero import/export)
- Uses PV to charge battery when production exceeds consumption
- Discharges battery when consumption exceeds PV production
- Grid used only when battery depleted or load exceeds inverter capacity

**2. Keep Batteries Charged Mode**
- Battery reserved for backup (grid failure)
- PV powers loads directly
- Battery only discharges during grid outage
- No active self-consumption optimization

### Key Features

**Configurable Battery Reserve**
- User sets % of battery capacity for self-consumption vs backup
- Example: 80% self-consumption, 20% backup reserve
- "Minimum SoC (unless grid fails)" setting

**Zero Export / Feed-In Control**
- Optional grid export of excess solar
- Fronius zero feed-in integration
- Prevents backflow without switching MPPT off

**Peak Shaving**
- Configurable on GX device
- Reduces grid demand during peak periods
- Basic implementation (not price-optimized)

**BatteryLife Feature**
- Dynamic SOC limit management
- Increases "activate SOC limit" by 5% daily if battery doesn't reach 100%
- Ensures periodic full charge for cell balancing
- Extends battery lifespan through DOD control

### Charging Strategy
Priority order:
1. Solar PV (MPPT chargers + grid-tie inverters)
2. Grid power (if allowed)
3. Generator (if configured)

### Grid Interaction
- "ESS will never use the grid to charge the battery, only PV"
- Excess solar → Battery → Grid export (if enabled)
- Deficit: PV → Battery → Grid import (if needed)

## Victron Dynamic ESS (2024)

### Core Innovation: Optimization-Based Control

**Objective**:
> "Minimize the costs made on the grid and battery, by using the grid and battery to indirectly control the energy flow"

### Input Data Sources

1. **Day-Ahead Electricity Prices**
   - ENTSO-E API (European markets)
   - Hourly prices for next 24-48 hours
   - Support for buy/sell price formulas (taxes, fees, margins)

2. **Solar Production Forecasts**
   - Victron VRM (Victron Remote Management) data
   - Location-based solar forecasts
   - Historical production patterns

3. **Consumption Estimates**
   - Historical usage patterns
   - Day-ahead consumption forecasts

4. **System Constraints**
   - Battery capacity and power limits
   - Grid import/export limits
   - SOC limits (min/max)

### Optimization Strategy

**Schedule Generation**:
- Creates battery charge/discharge schedule for upcoming day(s)
- Determines optimal timing for:
  - Grid purchases (buy low)
  - Battery discharge (avoid high prices)
  - Grid sales (sell high, if profitable)

**Two Operating Modes**:

1. **Follow Target SOC**
   - Maintains specific state-of-charge targets
   - Scheduled charging/discharging to meet SOC goals
   - Maximizes arbitrage opportunities

2. **Minimize Grid Usage**
   - Prioritizes battery over grid
   - Maximizes self-consumption
   - Reduces grid dependency

**Intelligent Restrictions**:
- "Prevent grid imports when buy price > (max sell price - battery cycle cost)"
- Avoids unprofitable cycling
- Considers battery degradation costs

**Green Mode**:
- Prioritizes self-consumption
- Reserves battery energy for local use
- Limits grid export to maximize on-site usage

### Forward-Looking Capability
- Uses tomorrow's prices once published (typically ~14:00 day-ahead)
- Adjusts schedule based on updated forecasts
- Rolling horizon optimization

## Key Insights from Victron's Approach

### 1. Standard ESS Limitations (Matches Our Findings)

Victron's **rule-based ESS** suffers from similar issues as our SimpleRule:
- Reactive, not predictive
- No price optimization
- Passive self-consumption (just zero import/export)
- Limited arbitrage capability

**This validates our diagnostic analysis**: Simple heuristics cannot exploit price volatility effectively.

### 2. Dynamic ESS Validates Our LP Approach

Victron's shift to **optimization-based control** confirms our recommendation:
- Day-ahead scheduling beats real-time rules
- Price forecasts enable profitable arbitrage
- Multi-factor optimization maximizes savings
- Forward-looking beats reactive

**Our proposed LP model aligns with industry best practices.**

### 3. Practical Implementation Considerations

**Grid Charging Economics**:
Victron explicitly allows grid charging in Dynamic ESS when profitable:
- "Prevent grid imports when buy price > (max sell price - battery cycle cost)"
- Considers battery degradation in optimization

**Our SimpleRule allows night charging** (0.3 price threshold), but:
- ❌ No cycle cost consideration
- ❌ No profitability check
- ❌ Fixed thresholds don't adapt

**Recommendation**: Add cycle cost constraint to LP model:
```
Buy_price + cycle_cost < expected_discharge_price
```

### 4. Battery Lifespan Management

Victron's **BatteryLife feature** is sophisticated:
- Dynamic SOC limit adjustments
- Ensures periodic 100% charge for cell balancing
- Extends battery life through intelligent DOD control

**Our implementation**:
- Fixed 10-90% SOC range
- No dynamic adjustment
- No cell balancing consideration

**Recommendation**: Add BatteryLife-style logic to LP model:
- Periodic full charge constraints
- Dynamic SOC limits based on usage patterns
- Degradation cost in objective function

### 5. Green Mode Concept

Victron's **Green Mode** prioritizes:
- Self-consumption over arbitrage
- Local energy use over grid export
- Reduced grid dependency

**Application to Norwegian context**:
- Feed-in tariff = 0.04 NOK/kWh (very low)
- Self-consumption value = 0.84 NOK/kWh (spot + tariff + tax)
- **21x value difference** strongly favors self-consumption

**Our model inherently prioritizes self-consumption** due to tariff structure - no "green mode" needed.

## Recommendations Based on Victron Analysis

### Phase 1: Implement Dynamic Optimization (Like Dynamic ESS)

**Core algorithm**:
```
Minimize: Total_Cost + Battery_Cycle_Cost

- Power limits (charge/discharge rates)
- SOC limits (min/max with periodic 100% charge)
- Grid limits (import/export caps)
- Peak demand tracking (monthly)
- Cycle cost constraints (avoid unprofitable cycling)
```

**Data requirements**:
- ✅ Day-ahead prices (ENTSO-E API) - already implemented

```python
# Periodic full charge for cell balancing
if days_since_full_charge > 7:
    force_soc_target = 100%
```

**3. Configurable Self-Consumption Reserve**
```python
# User-defined backup reserve
min_soc_normal = 10%  # Daily cycling
min_soc_grid_fail = 50%  # Emergency reserve
```

**4. Peak Shaving Integration**
```python
# Track and minimize monthly peak
monthly_peak_cost = get_power_tariff(monthly_peak_kw)
objective += monthly_peak_cost
```
