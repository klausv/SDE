# Baseline Configuration - No Battery
#
# Calculates system performance WITHOUT battery storage to establish
# economic baseline for ROI comparison. Uses same infrastructure as
# battery simulations but bypasses optimization solvers.
#
# Performance: ~0.001s (instant) vs 30-60s for LP/MPC solvers
# Use Case: Economic baseline for comparing battery investment

# Simulation mode
mode: baseline  # or set mode: monthly with battery.capacity_kwh: 0

# Time resolution
time_resolution: "PT60M"  # Hourly resolution (PT15M for 15-minute)

# Simulation period
simulation_period:
  start_date: "2024-01-01"
  end_date: "2024-12-31"

# Battery configuration - SET TO ZERO FOR BASELINE
battery:
  capacity_kwh: 0.0      # Zero battery capacity (baseline mode)
  power_kw: 0.0          # Zero battery power (baseline mode)
  efficiency: 0.90       # Not used in baseline

# Notes
# ------
# This configuration calculates baseline costs WITHOUT battery:
#   - Grid import costs
#   - Grid export revenue
#   - Power tariff costs
#   - Curtailment losses (when PV > grid limit)
#
# Compare with battery simulation to calculate:
#   - Annual savings = baseline_cost - battery_cost
#   - Payback period = battery_investment / annual_savings
#   - NPV = sum(savings / (1+r)^t) - investment
#   - IRR = rate where NPV = 0
#
# Example usage:
#   python main.py run --config configs/baseline_monthly.yaml
#
#   # Then compare with battery simulation
#   python scripts/report_cli.py compare baseline_id battery_id
