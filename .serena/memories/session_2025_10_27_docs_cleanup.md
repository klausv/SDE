## Next Steps (from README.md TODO)

### Core Documentation Needed
- [ ] PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md - What this project does and why
- [ ] ARCHITECTURE.md - Current system architecture and design
- [ ] GETTING_STARTED.md - Installation and quick start guide
- [ ] API_REFERENCE.md - Module and function reference

### Technical Documentation
- [ ] CONFIGURATION.md - Configuration options and parameters
- [ ] DATA_FLOW.md - How data moves through the system
- [ ] ALGORITHMS.md - Optimization algorithms and methodology

### Development Documentation
- [ ] TESTING.md - Testing strategy and running tests
- [ ] CONTRIBUTING.md - Development workflow and standards
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md - Version history and changes

## Important Notes
- All old documentation referenced pre-cleanup codebase
- Fresh start ensures docs match current clean architecture
- 26 historical files preserved in archive for reference
