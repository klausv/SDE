# Session 2025-10-29: Battery System Electrical Topology Implementation

## Completed Work

### 1. Complete Electrical Topology Implementation
Implemented proper energy flow model with all physical constraints:

```
Solar PV (DC, 138.55 kWp)
    ↓
Solar Inverter (110 kW clipping) → Losses: 588 kWh/year
    ↓
AC Bus ←→ Battery Bi-directional Inverter (98% eff) ←→ Battery (DC, C-rate limits)
    ↓
Grid Connection (77 kW export limit) → Curtailment: 974 kWh/year
```

### 2. Core Components Created

**Battery Class (core/battery.py)**
- SOC tracking with min/max limits (10%-90%)
- Roundtrip efficiency (90%)
- C-rate constraints: max_c_rate_charge/discharge = 1.0
- Power rating enforcement (20 kWh, 10 kW tested)
- Methods: charge(), discharge(), get_available_charge/discharge_power()

**Strategy Pattern (core/strategies.py)**
- Abstract base: ControlStrategy
- NoControlStrategy: Reference case without battery
- SimpleRuleStrategy: HEMS-like heuristic
  - Charge on solar surplus or cheap night prices
  - Discharge on high consumption or expensive prices
- Extensible for LP optimization strategy

**Simulator (core/simulator.py)**
- Models complete energy flow with inverters
- Tracks DC and AC power separately
- Applies inverter clipping at 110 kW
- Enforces grid export limit at 77 kW
- Calculates curtailment losses
- Handles battery inverter efficiency (98%)
- Returns comprehensive results DataFrame with columns:
  - production_dc_kw, production_ac_kw
  - inverter_clipping_kw, curtailment_kw
  - battery_power_dc_kw, battery_power_ac_kw
  - battery_soc_kwh, grid_power_kw

### 3. Annual Simulation Results

**Reference Case (No Battery):**
- Net import: 212,703 kWh
- Net export: 38,421 kWh
- Peak import: 78.7 kW
- Grid cost (simplified): 120,425 NOK
- Inverter clipping: 588 kWh/year (0.46% of DC production)
- Curtailment: 974 kWh/year (0.76% of production)

**SimpleRule Strategy (20 kWh/10 kW battery):**
- Net import: 212,359 kWh
- Net export: 37,956 kWh
- Peak import: 78.7 kW (no reduction)
- Grid cost: 120,034 NOK
- Savings: 391 NOK/year (0.3%)
- Battery cycles: 36/year
- Inverter clipping: 588 kWh (unchanged)
- Curtailment: 974 kWh (unchanged)

### 4. Key Insights

**Physical Losses Identified:**
1. **Inverter Clipping (588 kWh/year)**: DC production exceeds 110 kW inverter capacity during peak solar hours
2. **Curtailment (974 kWh/year)**: AC production exceeds 77 kW grid export limit - this is the larger bottleneck

**Battery Performance:**
- Current SimpleRule strategy provides minimal savings (391 NOK/year)
- Does NOT reduce peak import (still 78.7 kW)
- Does NOT reduce curtailment or clipping losses
- Indicates need for smarter control strategy (LP optimization)

### 5. Next Steps (Documented in todo.md)

**Immediate:**
1. Implement economic function C(t) with all cost components:
   - Spot prices
   - Time-of-use energy tariff (peak/offpeak)
   - Electricity tax (monthly variation)
   - Power tariff (monthly peak-based, progressive brackets)
   - Margins/markups
   - VAT (25%)

2. Monthly peak as state variable:
   - Track max_import_power_this_month
   - Update each timestep
   - Use for power tariff calculation
   - Critical for LP optimization (affects future costs)

3. Additional heuristic strategy (Heuristik 2):
   - Options: Peak shaving, curtailment reduction, or combined
   - To be defined before LP implementation

**Future:**
4. LP optimization model:
   - Decision: Monthly vs annual horizon
   - 24-hour rolling window
   - Three revenue streams: arbitrage, power tariff reduction, curtailment reduction
   - Perfect foresight within horizon

## Technical Decisions

1. **C-rate Implementation**: Added to Battery class, limits charge/discharge to 1.0C (capacity-dependent)
2. **Inverter Efficiency**: Battery inverter 98% for both charge and discharge
3. **Data Consistency**: Using PVGIS typical year (2020) for all simulations
4. **Battery Size**: Changed from 100kWh/50kW to 20kWh/10kW for realistic commercial scenario

## User Preferences Noted

- Wants economic function as C(t) formula
- Emphasis on monthly peak as state variable for LP
- Concerned about monthly vs annual optimization horizon trade-offs
- Planning to implement LP optimization after economic model complete
