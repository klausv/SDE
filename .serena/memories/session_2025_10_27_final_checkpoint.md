**Date**: 2025-10-27
**Time**: ~22:33 (commit timestamp)
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED - Switching to NSKdashboard debug
**Project**: offgrid2 - Battery Optimization

## Session Accomplishments

### 1. SuperClaude Framework Configuration ✅
- **nivåmetoden-agent**: Successfully configured in CLAUDE.md (inline)
- Added comprehensive Pyramid Principle/Nivåmetoden instructions
- Enhanced with MECE validation, SCQA framework, behavioral guidelines
- Deleted redundant `/home/klaus/.claude/nivåmetoden.md`
- **Location**: `/home/klaus/.claude/CLAUDE.md` lines 354-475

### 2. Documentation Cleanup ✅ 
**Phase 1 - Initial Archive** (16 files):
- MILP formulations and migration guides
- Old analysis results and workflows
- Historical structure documentation
- Test reports (interim versions)

**Phase 2 - Complete Reset** (9 files):
- CLASS_DIAGRAM.md, PROJECT_ARCHITECTURE.md
- All test results and strategies
- Code duplication analysis
- Maintenance guides

**Artifacts Removed**:
- Personal PDF files (tvangsinnkreving)
- Outdated Offgrid-diagram.svg

**Final Structure**:
```
docs/
├── README.md (NEW - with TODO list)
├── reference/nivåmetoden.md (methodology)
└── archive/pre_rebuild_2025_10_27/ (26 files)
```

### 3. Git Commit ✅
- **Commit**: `8f7cd5bb6cd9c2b12831a61e38f68442eb44c841`
- **Message**: "docs: comprehensive documentation cleanup and archive"
- **Stats**: 43 files changed, +2330/-4 lines
- **Includes**: Both code archive (to_rebuild) and docs cleanup

## Session Learnings

### Claude Code Workflow Insights
1. **Sequential tool execution** - Must wait for tool_result before next tool
2. **Todo tracking essential** - User caught me stopping mid-execution
3. **Plan mode awareness** - Need to properly exit plan mode before execution
4. **Agent definitions** - Inline in CLAUDE.md preferred over separate files

### Project Understanding
1. **Documentation was outdated** - All 26 files described pre-cleanup codebase
2. **Clean slate approach** - Better to archive all and start fresh
3. **Archive structure** - Timestamped folders preserve history
4. **Git shows full scope** - Commit included both code and docs cleanup

### Serena MCP Usage
1. **Memory persistence** - `write_memory()` for cross-session continuity
2. **Project activation** - Required before memory operations
3. **Session management** - `/sc:load` and `/sc:save` for workflow
4. **Checkpoint creation** - Preserves context for project switches

## Current Project State

### Clean Documentation
- ✅ All outdated docs archived
- ✅ Fresh README.md with comprehensive TODO list
- ✅ Reference materials organized separately
- ⏳ New documentation pending (see README.md for list)

### Code Status (from earlier commits)
- ✅ Code cleanup completed (archive/to_rebuild/)
- ✅ Core modules restructured
- ⏳ Rebuild needed based on clean architecture

### Git Status
- ✅ All changes committed
- ✅ Working tree clean
- ✅ Ready for next phase

---

## Next Steps (When Returning)

### Immediate Priority
1. **Review codebase structure** - Understand current clean architecture
2. **Create ARCHITECTURE.md** - Document new system design
3. **Write GETTING_STARTED.md** - Enable fresh contributors

### Documentation TODO (from README.md)
**Core**: PROJECT_OVERVIEW, ARCHITECTURE, GETTING_STARTED, API_REFERENCE
**Technical**: CONFIGURATION, DATA_FLOW, ALGORITHMS
**Development**: TESTING, CONTRIBUTING, CHANGELOG

### Rebuild Planning
- Review `archive/to_rebuild/` contents
- Decide what to resurrect vs. rewrite
- Create migration plan for essential functionality

## Context Switch Note

**Switching To**: NSKdashboard debugging
**Reason**: Urgent issue requiring immediate attention
**Return Expected**: After NSKdashboard issue resolved

**Resume Command**: `/sc:load` 
**This Memory**: `session_2025_10_27_final_checkpoint`
**Related Memory**: `session_2025_10_27_docs_cleanup`

---

## Questions for Next Session

1. Should we start with ARCHITECTURE.md or PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md?
2. Which archived code modules are highest priority to rebuild?
3. Are the test results in archive still relevant for validation?
4. Should we create new test strategy or adapt archived TESTING_STRATEGY.md?

**Session Duration**: ~2-3 hours
**Completion**: 100% (all planned tasks)
**Blockers**: None
**Status**: ✅ Clean checkpoint - Ready for context switch
